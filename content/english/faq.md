Here's where we put the FAQs. 

They're going to be in sections like this:

1. [IETF Logo & Acronym](/faq/logofaq.md)
2. Reproducing RFCs
3. etc


I know [this page](/administration/minutes) exists, can I link to that?  
Or maybe [this way](/administration/minutes.md)?   
Or [this](/content/english/administration/minutes) way?
