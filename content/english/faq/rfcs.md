**Who owns the copyright in RFCs?**  
The general rule is that original authors retain copyright unless they make an explicit transfer of their rights. The IETF and the RFC Editor have never required this. Hence the underlying copyright in RFCs remains with the original authors (or their employers, if their employment conditions so stipulate).

**So what does the copyright statement in many RFCs mean?**  
It means that the Internet Society originally owned the copyright on behalf of the IETF in those parts of RFCs that are the result of collective work, the standard material (“boilerplate”) included in all RFCs, and the RFC numbering series. As part of the IETF Administrative Support Activity realignment, the Internet Society has formally transferred its rights to the IETF Trust.

**Where are the full rules?**  
The IETF’s rules on copyright issues are in BCP 78, whose current version (as of May 2020) is RFC 5378.

**Am I allowed to reproduce whole RFCs?**  
Yes. Since the beginning of the RFC series, reproduction of whole RFCs (including translation into a language other than English) has been allowed and encouraged. The IETF Trust and the RFC Editor place no restrictions on this. Most RFCs include the standard phrase “Distribution of this memo is unlimited” to indicate this.

**Do I need to contact the authors?**  
The policy just described is well known to RFC authors. However, it is a matter of courtesy to contact them if formal republication is planned (as opposed to usage for educational purposes and the like). It has been known for original authors to object to certain types of commercial republication.

**Am I allowed to reproduce extracts from RFCs?**  
It is common to use extracts from RFCs that are in the form of computer code by incorporating them in software. This is the only usage formally allowed by the current IETF rules (RFC 5378). Generally speaking the IETF Trust will tolerate fair use of other extracts, but you must indicate the source of the extract and you must mention the original copyright statement if present.

**Am I allowed to publish modified extracts from RFCs?**  
It is acceptable under the current IETF rules (RFC 5378) to modify extracted code if necessary. Modification of other extracts requires the permission of the original authors. The IETF Trust does not in general grant the right to create derivative works of RFCs; in fact it does not have the right to do so, under the current IETF rules (RFC 5378). The IETF is currently discussing various possible modifications of its rules to permit the publishing of modified extracts in certain circumstances.

**Why are RFCs copyrighted instead of open source?**  
This is a complex issue, but an important part of the reason is that the IETF historically wished to retain change control of its technical specifications, unless it consciously decides to hand it over to another standards body.

**How can I put code from RFCs under an open source license?**  
We haven’t found a legally perfect answer to this question. However, the IETF Trust has no intention of taking any action that will cause difficulty for open source software containing code from RFCs.

**Does this FAQ apply to every RFC?**  
Not all RFCs originate in the IETF. A minority come from other sources (the IAB, the IRTF, and independent submissions reviewed directly by the RFC Editor). Also, numerous RFCs were published prior to the existence of the IETF (i.e. prior to January 1986). The IETF Trust cannot offer definitive advice in these cases. If in doubt, please seek independent legal advice.
