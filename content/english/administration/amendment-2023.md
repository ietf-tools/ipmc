# Notice of Proposed Amendment to IETF IPMC Bylaws

November 8, 2023

The IETF Trustees are proposing a small pair of amendments to the IETF Int P M C bylaws with the intent of improving transparency for future changes to the corporation’s bylaws and to acknowledge the IETF LLC, which was not around when the original IETF Trust was created.

The Trustees have also decided to apply the proposed 60 day notice period as part of these amendment changes, so there will be a 60 day notice period beginning 11/08/2023 before the Trustees vote to formally adopt the proposed changes.

Redline copy of the [Proposed Amended Bylaws](/uploads/Bylaws-Proposed-Amendments-2023-REDLINE.pdf) reflecting the proposed changes is available.

The existing copy of the Bylaws can be found on the [Founding Documents](/content/english/administration/bylaws.md) page.
