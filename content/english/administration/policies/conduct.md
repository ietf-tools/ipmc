## IETF IPMC Standards of Conduct 

Those who take part in the work of the IPMC, including IPMC Directors, volunteers,
IETF LLC and support staff assigned to work on IPMC matters, undertake to

* **Act** in accordance with IPMC's Bylaws. In particular, participants undertake
to act within the mission of IPMC and in the spirit of the values contained in
the Bylaws.
* **Adhere** to IPMC's policies as from time to time in force.
* **Treat** all members of the IPMC community equally, irrespective of nationality,
gender or gender identification, racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs,
disability, age, or sexual orientation; members of the IPMC community should
treat each other with civility both face-to-face and online.
* **Respect** all members of the IPMC community equally, behave in a
professional manner and demonstrate appropriate behavior. IPMC strives to
create and maintain an environment in which people of all backgrounds and
cultures are treated with dignity, decency, and respect. Specifically,
participants in the work of the IPMC must not engage in any type of
harassment. Generally, harassment is considered unwelcome hostile,
intimidating behavior -- in particular, speech or behavior that is sexually
aggressive or unwanted or that intimidates based on attributes such as race,
gender, gender identification, ethnicity, religion, age, color, national origin,
ancestry, disability or medical condition, sexual orientation, or gender
identity.
* **Act** in a reasonable, objective and informed manner when participating in
policy development and decision-making processes. This includes coming
prepared for and regularly attending all scheduled meetings, engaging
cooperatively with other directors, leadership, staff and volunteers, and
exercising independent judgment based solely on the IPMCâ€™s remit as
reflected in its Bylaws, policies, and applicable RFCs, irrespective of personal
interests and the interests of the entity to which an individual might owe their
appointment.
* **Support** the maintenance of robust mechanisms for public input,
accountability, and transparency so as to ensure that policy development and
decision-making processes will reflect the public interest and be accountable
to all stakeholders.
* **Protect** the organization's assets and ensure their efficient and effective use.
* **Act** fairly and in good faith with other participants in the IPMC process.
* **Promote** ethical and responsible behavior. Ethics and integrity are essential,
and IPMC expects all stakeholders to behave in a responsible and principled
way.

Adopted by the Board of Directors by unanimous resolution on 08 January 2025.
